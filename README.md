This project is a Bank Management System developed using Java, Spring Boot, SQL, and Postman for API testing. It demonstrates how a single bank can operate with multiple branches, where each branch manages its own customers, accounts, and transactions. The system is built with a layered architecture that includes controllers, services, repositories, and entity models, making the project easy to understand and maintain. Through this application, users can perform essential banking operations such as adding new branches, registering customers, creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing money, and viewing transaction history. The APIs are fully REST-based and can be tested through Postman, while the backend uses MySQL for persistent storage. This project showcases core concepts such as CRUD operations, relational database mapping, REST API development, and the use of Spring Boot for building scalable applications. It serves as a solid foundation for anyone learning backend development or exploring how real-world banking systems manage data and relationships.
